# Automated-Cattle-detection

The intersection of computer vision and agriculture holds immense promise for revolutionizing traditional practices. One such breakthrough is the development of object detection algorithms like YOLO (You Only Look Once), which enables efficient and accurate identification of objects within images or video frames in real-time. By harnessing the power of deep learning and image processing techniques, we aim to showcase how YOLO can significantly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of cattle monitoring and management, ultimately contributing to the advancement of modern agricultural practices.
